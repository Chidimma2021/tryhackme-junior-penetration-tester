My learning journey, notes, and write-ups from the TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester path.
# TryHackMe - Junior Penetration Tester Journey  

This repository documents my learning and hands-on labs from the **Junior Penetration Tester** path on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).  
It serves as both a portfolio of my progress and a reference for the skills I have built while preparing for penetration testing and cybersecurity roles.  

Each folder corresponds to a section of the learning path and contains detailed notes, write-ups, and practical exercises from the rooms Iâ€™ve completed.
